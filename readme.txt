Display your business's contact details with seo-friendly Schema.org markup. Supports a Google Map, opening hours and more.

== Description ==

Add your business contact details to your site with seo-friendly Schema.org markup. This plugin adds a Contact Card widget and a  `[contact-card]` shortcode. You can use these to display the following on any page:

* Business name
* Address
* Phone number
* Contact page link or email address
* Link to Google Map with directions to your establishment
* Google Map showing your location
* Opening hours

Schema.org markup helps search engines like Google discover your address, phone number and opening hours so that they can display them with your listing on Google.

**Sorry, it does not support multiple locations.**

This plugin is part of a group of plugins in development for restaurants. Check out the [Food and Drink Menu](http://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/) and [Restaurant Reservations](http://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations/) plugins as well.
